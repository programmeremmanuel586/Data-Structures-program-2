# Data-Structures-program-2

The assignment was to create a Slot Machine program using a circular linked list to represent the reels. The goal was to keep track of the player's earning depenping on what combination of characters the player got. For every new game, the player starts at $100 and to get more cash, you have to get a spin combo of either AAA for $6, BBB for $15, CCC for $50, and 777 for $500 dollars! The player pays $1 per spin. If the player reaches $0, the game ends. The user can also quit the game at any time.

I was still new to classes and should have used .h header files instead of .hpp files, which are for .cpp files without header files.

This project also used a makefile so you may run into errors running this on a text editor, but running the `make` command in the terminal compliles the file perfectly.

Of course, I am constantly working on my C++ skills, but having to work with classes and a data structure successfully, this is something I am proud of :D

The only way is up from here. Constant growth and learning is the only way to go.
